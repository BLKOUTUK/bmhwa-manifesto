## Key Decisions Pending

1. **Platform**: Webflow (~£20/mo) vs Astro+Netlify (£0) vs WordPress — depends on budget and tech comfort (survey Q12-13)
2. **Assess & Align integration**: Embedded vs linked vs featured — depends on tool status (technical survey Q11-13)
3. **Newsletter platform**: Mailchimp vs other — depends on existing setup (technical survey Q7)
4. **Content readiness**: What exists vs what needs writing (survey Q8)

## MVP (if timeline compressed)

3 pages that can launch independently:
1. **Home** — hero, manifesto summary, key stats, CTA
2. **The Manifesto** — full text, PDF download
3. **Take Action** — pledge form, share toolkit
