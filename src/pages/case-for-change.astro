      <p class="section-label">Setting the Scene</p>
      <h2 id="system-heading">The system wasn&rsquo;t designed for us</h2>

      <p>Although we have made great strides in mental health care in the UK, inequalities in access, experience, and outcomes continue to persist. For Black people, these disparities are stark and often rooted in racism and discrimination. Race and ethnicity are not known risk factors for poor mental health &mdash; which points to racism, not race, as an undeniable factor.</p>

      <p>The mental health system in England was built on white, Eurocentric norms. Its diagnostic frameworks, treatment models, and commissioning structures were designed without Black communities in mind. The field of psychiatry itself has origins entangled with eugenics and scientific racism &mdash; frameworks that pathologised Black people rather than understanding them.</p>

      <p>This is not new knowledge. Reports going back over 20 years &mdash; from the Blofeld Report (2003) to the Independent Review of the Mental Health Act (2018) &mdash; contain recommendations that remain unfulfilled. The David &ldquo;Rocky&rdquo; Bennett inquiry, Inside Outside, Delivering Race Equality, the Crisp Commission &mdash; each made urgent calls for change. Many of those same calls appear in this Manifesto because the system has failed to act on them.</p>

      <p>The Black Mental Health and Wellbeing Alliance was formed because waiting for the system to fix itself is not an option. The Manifesto is a demand for structural change &mdash; and a refusal to accept another 20 years of unfulfilled promises.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="economic-text">
          <p>Addressing racial disparities in mental health is not only a moral imperative &mdash; it is an economic one. When Black people are detained rather than treated early, when community organisations are defunded, when practitioners lack cultural competency, the costs are borne by everyone.</p>
          <p>Investment in prevention, community-based services, and culturally responsive interventions delivers better outcomes at lower cost. The NHS Long Term Plan acknowledges this. The evidence supports it. What is missing is the political will to act.</p>
          <p>A mental health system in which Black people can flourish is a system that works better for everyone.</p>
