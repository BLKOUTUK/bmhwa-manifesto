      <h2 id="about-heading">Who we are</h2>
      <p>The Black Mental Health and Wellbeing Alliance is a collective of individuals with lived experience and grassroots organisations in the mental health sector, with a primary focus on tackling racial inequalities that disproportionately impact Black people.</p>
      <p>The Manifesto serves as a point of reference for the Government, healthcare professionals, those working in education, practitioners, policymakers and anyone involved in or accountable for instigating change.</p>
      <p>Through collaboration, we can dismantle systemic barriers and develop a mental health system that genuinely meets the needs of all communities, including the Black community.</p>

        <p>When community members speak, it&rsquo;s essential that we listen.</p>

      <p class="section-label">Setting the Scene</p>
      <h2 id="scene-heading">The crisis and the path forward</h2>
      <p>Although we have made great strides in mental health care in the UK, inequalities in access, experience and outcomes continue to persist. For Black people, these disparities are stark and often rooted in racism and discrimination.</p>
      <p>Black people are more likely to experience a common mental health problem, have higher rates of PTSD and suicide risk, and are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Despite these high prevalence rates, Black adults have the lowest treatment rates. The evidence is clear that race and ethnicity are not known risk factors for poor mental health &mdash; which points to racism, not race, as an undeniable factor.</p>
      <p>Many mental health initiatives, reforms, and services have not yet been able to address the needs of Black people in tangible ways. Reports going as far back as over 20 years ago contain unfulfilled recommendations. The Black Mental Health Manifesto seeks to be a catalyst for that change.</p>

      <h2 id="part1-heading">Addressing Structural Drivers</h2>
      <p class="part-intro">Structural inequities contribute to poorer mental health outcomes. Black communities in Britain are disproportionately impacted by known risk factors &mdash; lower-income households, overcrowded housing, higher unemployment, and school exclusions. Racism and discrimination are at the heart of these inequalities. Action can be taken to break these cycles.</p>
